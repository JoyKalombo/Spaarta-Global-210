# Unit testing:
# Breaking down the whole code into components in order to ensure that things are good (as you go along)

#
# Bunch of frameworks for unit tesing (PyTest)
#
# Lots of assertions are inherited from the TestCase base class (check out the doc of assertions...)

# This is a great resource to practise TDD
